I worked at a VC firm over the summer investing in AI-enabled startups and with a focus on the business opportunities of pre-trained AI models. Huggingface, holds the broadest offering for non-industry/non-academic experimentors to develop using industry-grade AI models. I also have some personal engineering projects that may *require* using huggingface models so I added the tutorial from their website above. Open source projects will enable non-technical (or at least less technical) founders to leverage pre-constructed code-- this is already visible with the rise of low-code/no-code projects.
