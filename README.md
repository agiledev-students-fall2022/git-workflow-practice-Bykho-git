I worked at a VC firm over the summer investing in AI-enabled startups and was stuck by my bosses appreciation and conviction in the economic power of *pre-trained AI models*. I share in his belief and huggingface, to date, is the top hub for non-industry/non-academic experimentors to develop using industry-grade AI models. I also have some personal engineering projects that may **require** using huggingface models so I added the tutorial from their website above. In the future, I believe that open source projects will enable non-technical (or at least less technical) founders to leverage pre-constructed code-- this is already visible with the rise of low-code/no-code projects.
